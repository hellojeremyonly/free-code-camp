# Introduction
FreeCodeCamp is an amazing platform that provides free online courses and coding challenges to help individuals learn and enhance their programming skills. As I progress through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, I complete various projects to apply what I have learned. This repository showcases these projects, encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing within the open-source community.

# Projects
This repository contains a collection of completed FreeCodeCamp projects. Each project is stored in its own dedicated folder and includes all the necessary files and resources to run and understand the project.
